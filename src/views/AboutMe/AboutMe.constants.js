Hello and welcome to my portfolio! The name is Derek Robertson, \
and I'm a full stack software engineer of 2 years hailing from the SF Bay Area. \


Despite my passion for computers however, I had always kept it as just a hobby. Fresh out of \
high school, I decided to get to work right away and utilize my existing mechanical skills \
and electrical knowledge and pursue a career as an Electric Motor Mechanic near home in \
Vallejo. For over a decade I swung hammers and turned wrenches, only occasionally blowing up a \
460 volt motor. Mechanic by day and gamer by night, my tech passion was kept solely as a hobby- \
until one fateful day. As the most tech literate person in the shop, I eventually ended up as the \
Systems Administrator in addition to my role as a Mechanic. Realizing that paper reports in a dirty \
mechanic shop in the 21st century doesn't work very well, I volunteered to modernize our workflow by \
setting up laptop work stations connected through cloud sharing, and started developing an electronic \
replacement for the paper repair report that had been in use in that shop for over 70 years. Not quite \
a true programmer yet, I ended up using the most fitting application I knew- Microsoft Excel. Yes, \
Excel. Many macros and much Visual Basic later and I had developed a truly interactive excel spread \
sheet, which is still in use there today (you can view it in my projects section!).

But it wouldn't be until a few years later that I would realize my true passion. After spending many \
hours tweaking the config files for a game rather than playing it, a friend and fellow developer asked \
me something life changing- "You know I've seen that excel sheet, if you enjoy spending so much time \
editing files and tweaking things, why don't you try coding?" And at that moment it clicked- if I \
could do that with excel, what can I do with a real programming language? And it's been game over \
for me since then. Thanks to FreeCodeCamp, I soon learned the magical powers of HTML, CSS, and \
Javascript. Suddenly I didn't need physical materials and money to build neat new things, I could do \
it all with a little bit of text and logic! With each challenge came a solution and success, which only \
furthered my drive. Ok so I built a website, how do I host it? Ok I have a droplet now, what other cool \
things can I do with it? The possibilities were limitless, which lead me to where I am today- \
living my dream as a developer!

Constantly in the pursuit of expanding my knowledge and skills, I'm always open to new opportunities. \
If you feel like I'm someone you'd want to work with feel free to give me a shout, and let's have a chat!
